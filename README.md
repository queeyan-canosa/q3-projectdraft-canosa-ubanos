**JavaScript Incorporation Description**

The way we will use JavaScript for our homepage is to allow users to enter the website by clicking on the images of the companies they wish to learn about. For this, we will use the onclick event so that when a picture of a company/group is clicked, it will be easily redirected to the website of the company/group. Furthermore, we will use window location, which is typically used to redirect the visitor from the current webpage to another one. Each of the company photos' IDs will correspond to the company's name.
